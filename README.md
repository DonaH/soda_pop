###User Story
* I'd like the game to be fun.
* I'd it to be colorful.
* I'd like it to be intuitive.

###Future Add on
* Sound would be nice. :heavy_check_mark:
* Soda Bottles with recognizable logos.
* 3D soda bottles (maybe).
* Better buttons. :heavy_check_mark:
* Animated page with a single soda bottle. When the soda goes all the way down to the bottom, a loud BURP as a reward!
